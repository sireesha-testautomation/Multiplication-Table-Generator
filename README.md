# Multiplication Table Generator (Java)

###  Description

This is a simple Java console application that generates and prints the multiplication table of a user-entered number from **1 to 10**.
It demonstrates basic Java concepts such as methods, loops, user input handling, and console output.

##  Features

* Takes user input from the console
* Generates a multiplication table up to 10
* Uses a separate method for better code structure
* Beginner-friendly and easy to understand

##  Technologies Used

* Java
* Scanner class for user input

##  Project Structure

```
MultiplicationTableGenerator.java
```

##  How to Run
1. Clone this repository:

   ```

## Sample Output

```
Enter a number for its multiplication table to be printed to console
5
Multiplication Table of number 5 is
